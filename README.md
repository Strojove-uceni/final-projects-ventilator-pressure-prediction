# Overview

This is the full repo of experiments we have run and the work we have done. The project is Ventilator Pressure Prediction and you can read more about it at the Kaggle competition website https://www.kaggle.com/c/ventilator-pressure-prediction/. 

If you do not want to be bothered with code, you can go straight to folder `DEMOS` which contains a Julia notebook, or to `vp_colab` for a Python notebook. Both can be either viewed or run. Unfortunatelly, Colab does not support Julia very easily, therefore you will need to install a few things, but do not worry, it does not take that much time and you can have a snack while you're waiting.

Most of the work done is in Julia language, since one of the students is familiar with it and wanted to code rather than copy from Google. You can go to the folder `Ventilator.jl` which has its own README file with more info.

# Note from the students

We are fully aware that our work is not state-of-the-art since we were not able to achieve the accuracy that fellow kagglers were able to. However, we wanted to learn and try some things and we believe we have achieved just that.

# Instruction and Evaluation

You can get maximum 100 points. Team with the highest score receives the prize. Final projects will be evaluated accordingly:

* **Idea (0-40 points)**
anything from Machine learning, own idea guarantees you at least 20%
if you have no Idea for your project, we can give you some (deducting 20% from your "idea" score)

* **Implementation (0-30 points)**
    upload your code (preferably in Python) on GitHub by 2.1.2022 23:59
    include working demo in Colab (clearly demonstrate your results)
    
* **Presentation (0-30 points)**
     present your project during the last Lab session on 6.1.2022
     duration 20 min., (PowerPoint/Beamer/...)
